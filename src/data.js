When I was unable to solve a problem, she quickly provided the documentation and guidance I needed to work through it while giving me the space to do so independently. Her ability to aid and empower others while allowing them to further develop their own problem-solving skills is what Iâ€™m most thankful for during our time working together. Her perseverance through technical issues and her willingness to give consideration to the opinions of others also contribute to her strong skills as a leader and a developer.',

Charise is a dedicated learner that never gives up, she will always seek help if needed and is always willing to return the favor if needed. I have spent many nights working on finding the right solution to an issue and Charise always was determined to find that solution no matter how frustrating or how long it took she never gave up until a solution was reached. In adding Charise to your team you are gaining a resilient, dedicated person that will do whatever it takes to succeed!',
